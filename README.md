Revamping the Delhi Metro Application
Making traveling in Delhi more efficient and less time consuming by revamping the complete Delhi Metro App.


Role 👨‍🎨
Led the design of end-to-end experience from onboarding to reaching the destination. I also conducted research, set up a base architecture, and co-design the complete application.

Outcome 🤞
Minimize the travel time required by reducing the time taken in the interaction points before and after we board the metro.

Overview
Delhi has had a bad rap when it came to travel satisfaction. In 2002, Delhi's government sought to change that by launching the fast-moving, convenient, and average-cost nature of the local metro - Delhi Metro.
Despite providing safe travel to more than 24 lakh commuters daily. The travel experience of most commuters (when traveling to a new destination) was unsatisfactory.



Goals 🎯
First, we needed to accumulate all the information regarding Delhi Public Transport, which was scattered all over the physical and virtual space.
Second, we needed to refresh and rethink what was an unreliable and fatigued product that had decayed over time and find a way to incorporate the scattered information in structed form
Last but certainly not least, we needed to regain the commuter's confidence and trust by introducing key features that will help in reducing the overall travel time. Features :                
+ Curated and personalized routes
+ Making Metro Card more independent 
+ Introducing Hotspots for getting autos or buses
+ Introduced AR to see the directions in real time
+ Voice Interaction to make illiterate or visibility impaired people
+ Personal Assistant “Merry”

Kickoff 🛴
Being a resident of the National Capital Region, I had already used every mode of public transport in the city, so I had a few thoughts about where were the cracks in the system.
So, to get up to speed as early as possible, we started the first kickoff meeting by sharing the personal experiences of Delhi transport

The kickoff was a fact-finding and scope definition exercise which I used as an opportunity to ask various questions regarding the current situation of public transport in their locality. Amongst the things I learned, a couple of things, in particular, stood out-
+ The first being that 80% of the total group didn't knew about the official Delhi Metro App.
+ The second was that apart from the journey itself, the most time taking situations were the Interaction Points like security checks, token vending, card buying and recharging, interchanging lines, etc.



Research 📃

For conducting user research, we followed the “research learning spiral” process, originated by  Erin Sanders at Frog. The research learning spiral is a five-step process for conducting user research-
In the first three steps of the spiral, we formulated and answered questions so that we can find out what we need to learn during your research to reduce the knowledge gap:

+ Objectives - These are the questions we are trying to answer. What do we need to know at this point in the design process? What are the knowledge gaps we need to fill?  These framing questions would take a “5 Ws and an H” structure : 


~ “Who?” questions help you to determine prospective audiences for your design work, defining their demographics and psychographics and your baseline recruiting criteria.
~ “What?” questions clarify what people might be doing, as well as what they’re using in your website, application or product.
~ “When?” questions help you to determine the points in time when people might use particular products or technologies, as well as daily routines and rhythms of behavior that might need to be explored.
~ “Where?” questions help you to determine contexts of use — physical locations where people perform certain tasks or use key technologies — as well as potential destinations on the Internet or devices that a user might want to access.
~ “Why?” questions help you to explain the underlying emotional and rational drivers of what a person is doing, and the root reasons for that behavior.
~ “How?” questions help you go into detail on what explicit actions or steps people take in order to perform tasks or reach their goals.
                  

+ Hypotheses - These are what we believe we already know. What are our team’s assumptions? What do we think we understand about our users, in terms of both their behaviors and our potential solutions to their needs?

+ Methods - These address how we plan to fill the gaps in our knowledge. Based on the time and people available, what methods should we select?
